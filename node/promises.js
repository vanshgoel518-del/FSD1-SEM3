// Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
/* Types of promises 
1. Pending- The promise is not yet resolved or rejected.
2. Resolved or Fulfilled- The promise has been resolved successfully.
3. Rejected- The promise has been rejected with an error.
